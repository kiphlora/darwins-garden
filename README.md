Darwin's Garden
=

Darwin's Garden is a collection of procedural content generation techniques, machine learning, and bio-inspired algorithms for augmenting human creativity.

A large focus will be on the **searching of large design spaces**, meaning that the methods can be used to create new engineering, design, and artistic ideas. The individual content elements will be explained and demonstrated in **explorables**.

Beyond these explorable tutorials, many of the algorithms will be used in conjunction to create game content for a 2D game called Darwin's Garden.
